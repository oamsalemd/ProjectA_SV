1. Provide Goel with elaborated documents about each sub-block
    -> Motivation
    -> Interface
    -> Operation (high-level)
2. Compile all sub-blocks and fix syntax
3. Begin to estimate throughput/latency of the total pipe based on sub-blocks.
    -> Maybe work up some Python-based parametric simulator (?)
